              'Disappointed' Zhou apologises for his part in opening lap
              incident at Hungarian GP

              Zhou Guanyu was full of remorse for the part he played in the
              opening lap collision at the Hungarian Grand Prix – with the Alfa
              Romeo driver also giving an insight into where it all went wrong
              for him at the start of the race. After qualifying in a
              career-high fifth place on Saturday, Zhou’s hopes of a third
              points scoring outing of the season on Sunday – after Australia
              and Spain – took a huge hit when a slow start saw him drop down
              the field. Zhou eventually got going
              and, as he looked to make his way back up the order, he collided
              with the rear of Daniel Ricciardo’s AlphaTauri, forcing the
              Australian into the back of Esteban Ocon, who also took out his
              Alpine team mate, Pierre Gasly. Reflecting on the action-packed
              start, after finishing 16th in Budapest, a disappointed Zhou said:
              “I think [the start] was finished after the getaway.
              Unfortunately, something was wrong, but I don’t know yet.

              Pit stop ‘didn’t make much difference’ with Piastri able to take
              the positives from P5 finish

              Oscar Piastri might have started behind his team mate in Hungary,
              but thanks to a great getaway and a racer’s instinct for picking a
              gap the Australian found himself running second behind Max
              Verstappen at the end of the first lap in Budapest. But the
              Australian wound up coming home a distant fifth at the end of an
              attritional race that saw the whole field need two stops thanks to
              high levels of tyre degradation. It was in the first pit stop
              period that Piastri lost out to his team mate with McLaren calling
              Lando Norris in first. With the undercut proving powerful, the
              Briton was able to gain enough time on his out-lap to draw level
              with Piastri as he exited the pit lane – and pull out an easy move
              on the rookie, whose tyres were not up to temperature.
              ‘We’ve proved some people wrong’ – Defiant Norris happy with
              back-to-back podiums for McLaren “I think it wasn’t ideal to come
              out behind Lando [Norris] but when you finish 30 seconds behind
              him, it didn’t make much difference,” Piastri said afterwards. “I
              think it was just a lot of tyre management, I couldn’t really do
              much more to defend. I mean I tried as hard as I could against
              Checo [Perez] and he was out of sight in about two laps.
            </p>
            <p class="padd-all-2">
              Piastri’s mid-race battle with a recovering Sergio Perez had the
              crowd on the edge of their seats, the McLaren man doing everything
              he could to make the Mexican’s life as hard as possible after
              Perez had overtaken around the outside into Turn 1. Piastri
              provided some tough opposition, sticking with the RB19 into Turn 2
              and even running wide and dipping a wheel on the grass, but
              ultimately, Perez had too much pace. “I think if we’d had the old
              car here we would have been probably a lap behind where we were
              now," said Piastri, referencing those upgrades that have
              transformed McLaren’s season of late. "Still a really positive
              weekend for the team, a good weekend for myself, just a lot to go
              through, digest and learn from.Each team brings unique strengths to the competition.

              Lando Norris cut a frustrated figure at times during the Hungarian Grand Prix, under pressure from cars behind and struggling to keep his emotions in check on the radio. But ultimately he once again delivered a perfect drive to take his car from third on the grid to second at the flag and score his second straight podium.
Starting on the clean side of the grid and with a slipstream from Lewis Hamilton ahead, not to mention the only front-runner with fresh mediums tyres fitted, many expected Norris to be feisty off the line. But he found himself boxed in by the squabbling Mercedes and Red Bull ahead and instead saw his team mate Oscar Piastri slip through to run second, with Norris in third.
There they remained until Norris was called in first for the opening pit stops, and a highly aggressive out-lap from the Englishman saw him side-by-side with Piastri when he came out of the pits. Norris was able to get his nose in front, and from there second looked assured until the late pressure came courtesy of a recovering Sergio Perez.

              TECH TUESDAY: Analysing Red Bull's significant bodywork upgrade brought to Hungary

              Red Bull’s second significant bodywork upgrade of the season appeared at the Hungaroring and it was based around a new radiator inlet shape which rearranged the aerodynamics around the whole upper bodywork.

The update was reported to be worth around 0.2s in simulation but this was the first time since Baku that a Red Bull had not sat on pole – though Verstappen missed it by only 0.003s.
